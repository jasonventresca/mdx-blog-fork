Enhance navigation and make content more accessible by creating anchor links to specific sections within a page. This feature is particularly useful for long-form content, such as guides or documentation, where users can quickly jump to relevant sections without excessive scrolling.

In this article, we'll describe how we implemented anchor links in MDX documents and why we chose this approach over alternatives. If you're a developer working with MDX or similar technologies, this will give you insight into our solution and help you implement something similar in your own projects.

## <div id="introduction">Introduction</div>

Anchor links are an excellent way to improve the usability of long-form content by allowing users to navigate directly to specific sections. In MDXBlog, we use a simple and effective approach to implement anchor links by utilizing `id` attributes on `div` elements.

## <div id="how-we-create-anchor-links">How We Create Anchor Links</div>

In MDXBlog, we use `id` attributes on headings and other section elements to enable anchor linking. These `id` attributes make it easy to link directly to specific sections of the document using anchor tags (`#`). Here's how it works:

### Section:

```mdx
## <div id="getting-started">Getting Started</div>

In this example, the `<div>` tag has an `id` attribute of "getting-started". This ID allows us to create a link to this section by using an anchor tag elsewhere in the document:
```

### Link to Section:

```mdx
[Getting Started](#getting-started)
```

When a user clicks on this link, they are automatically scrolled to the section with the corresponding `id`. This method is straightforward, semantic, and works out-of-the-box in any MDX document.

### <div id="why-we-use-id-attributes-in-divs">Why We Use `id` Attributes in `divs`</div>

- **Flexibility**: By using `div` elements with `id` attributes, we can apply additional styles or classes to sections beyond what's available in markdown syntax.
- **Control**: We can fine-tune the layout of sections with more complex designs while still enabling anchor linking.
- **SEO-Friendly**: This method keeps the HTML output clean and ensures that the content structure remains clear for search engines.

## <div id="scroll-margin-for-fixed-navbar-support">Scroll Margin for Fixed Navbar Support</div>

If you're using a fixed navbar at the top of your page, anchor links might cause the target section to scroll underneath the navbar, making it partially or completely hidden. To avoid this issue, we use the `scroll-margin-top` property in CSS to create an offset that ensures the target section remains visible.

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Add CSS to Adjust Scroll Behavior**: In your global CSS file (e.g., `globals.css`), add the following rule to create a margin above any element with an `id` when it is scrolled into view:

   ```css
   [id] {
     scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Adjust this value to match the height of your fixed navbar */
   }
   ```

   This property sets a margin of 80px at the top of each section, ensuring that when a section is scrolled into view via an anchor link, it doesn't get hidden beneath the navbar.

2. **Why This Works**:
   - When a user clicks an anchor link (e.g., `[Jump to Custom Components](#custom-components)`), the browser normally scrolls the target element to the very top of the page. If you have a fixed navbar, the top of the section can get obscured.
   - By adding `scroll-margin-top`, the browser leaves a gap above the section, effectively pushing the section down by the specified amount (80px in this case), so it remains fully visible.

This small tweak ensures a smooth navigation experience, especially for users of long-form content or documentation where anchor links are frequently used.

## <div id="alternatives-we-considered">Alternatives We Considered</div>

There are other methods we could have used for anchor linking in MDXBlog, but they didn’t fit our needs as well as the `id` attribute approach.

### <div id="auto-generated-ids">Auto-Generated IDs</div>

- **How it works**: Some libraries automatically generate `id` attributes for headings (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) based on the heading text. This allows for linking without manually setting the `id`.
- **Why we didn’t choose it**: While auto-generated IDs reduce the need for manual `id` creation, they can be unpredictable if the heading text changes. Additionally, it’s harder to customize the exact format or style of the `id` attributes.

### <div id="manual-heading-ids">Manual Heading IDs</div>

- **How it works**: In this method, we manually add `id` attributes to headings (`<h2 id="section">Section Title</h2>`).
- **Why we didn’t choose it**: While this is a straightforward approach, it limits our control over styling and customization. Using `div` tags with IDs instead allows for greater flexibility in organizing content and applying additional styles.

### <div id="javascript-scroll-management">JavaScript Scroll Management</div>

- **How it works**: This method involves using JavaScript to dynamically manage scrolling to different sections, typically using event listeners or smooth scrolling libraries.
- **Why we didn’t choose it**: Although this allows for smoother scroll transitions, it adds unnecessary complexity and JavaScript dependencies to the project. We wanted a simple, lightweight solution that relied purely on HTML and CSS.

## <div id="why-this-approach-works-best-for-mdxblog">Why This Approach Works Best for MDXBlog</div>

- **Simplicity**: This solution uses plain HTML with no additional dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to implement.
- **Maintainability**: By keeping the solution simple and predictable, we can easily add, remove, or update anchor links without worrying about breaking the layout.
- **Performance**: This approach avoids the need for JavaScript, ensuring faster load times and better performance, especially on static sites.

## <div id="implementing-this-in-your-mdx-project">Implementing This in Your MDX Project</div>

To implement this anchor link method in your own MDX project, follow these steps:

1. **Add `id` Attributes to Sections**: Wherever you have a section that you want to link to, wrap the heading in a `div` tag with an `id`. For example:

   ```mdx
   ## <div id="my-section">My Section</div>
   ```

2. **Create Links to Sections**: Link to sections by using the `#` symbol followed by the `id` value in your anchor tags:

   ```mdx
   [Go to My Section](#my-section)
   ```

3. **Add CSS for Fixed Navbar Support (Optional)**: If you have a fixed navbar, include the following CSS rule to ensure the sections are visible when scrolled into view:

   ```css
   [id] {
     scroll-margin-top: 80px;
   }
   ```

4. **Optional Styling**: If you want to style the sections differently, apply CSS classes to the `div` tags.

By following these steps, you'll be able to easily create anchor links in your MDX documents and ensure smooth navigation for users, even when using a fixed navbar.
