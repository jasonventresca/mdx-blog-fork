This project is a lightweight demo of an MDX-powered blog using **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, and the `@/next/mdx` package. It’s designed for developers who want a clear, working example of how to compile and render local `.mdx` files in a modern Next.js app using the App Router and Server Components.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/owolfdev/mdx-next15-react19)

[Deployed app](https://mdx-next15-react19.vercel.app/)

There are no extra features — just the essentials:

- Local `.mdx` content loading via dynamic import
- Layout styling using Tailwind CSS and `prose`
- Component overrides using `useMDXComponents`
- Compatible with React 19 and async props in Next.js 15

This is **not** a full-featured blog platform — it’s a focused reference implementation. If you're looking to understand how MDX fits into the latest Next.js architecture with server rendering, this project should provide a clear starting point.

Feel free to clone, adapt, or extend it for your own content workflows.
