When working with images in a Next.js project, using the built-in `next/image` component is the recommended approach for optimized loading, automatic resizing, and improved performance. However, customizing `next/image` to fit various layouts while maintaining responsiveness and loading enhancements can be tricky.

This article introduces a reusable `CustomImage` component (`custom-image.tsx`) designed to provide seamless aspect ratio maintenance, a skeleton loader, and caption support.

## MDX Compatibility

The `CustomImage` component is fully compatible with MDX content, making it easy to embed optimized images directly within Markdown files. This is particularly useful for blog posts, documentation, and other content-driven projects in Next.js.

<Image
  src="/images/posts/philosophers/western/thales-of-miletus.jpg"
  alt="Thales of Miletus"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  caption="Example of the CustomImage component in use."
/>

### Example Usage in MDX

When using `CustomImage` in an MDX file, simply import the component and embed it within the Markdown content:

```mdx
import CustomImage from "../components/custom-image";

<CustomImage
  src="/images/posts/philosophers/western/thales-of-miletus.jpg"
  alt="Thales of Miletus"
  width={800}
  height={500}
  caption="Thales of Miletus"
/>

**Thales of Miletus** was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer, often regarded as the first philosopher in Western tradition. A native of the Ionian city of Miletus, he sought to explain natural phenomena without relying on mythology, marking a shift toward rational inquiry. He proposed that water is the fundamental substance (archê) of all things, laying the groundwork for later natural philosophy.
```

This approach allows you to seamlessly integrate images within your content while leveraging Next.js optimizations.

## Component Overview

The `CustomImage` component, implemented in `custom-image.tsx`, wraps Next.js's `next/image` component and enhances it with additional features:

- **Maintains Aspect Ratio**: Dynamically calculates the aspect ratio from `width` and `height` props, ensuring the image scales correctly.
- **Skeleton Loader**: Displays a subtle loading animation until the image fully loads.
- **Automatic Responsive Behavior**: Uses absolute positioning to maintain layout integrity.
- **Optional Caption**: Displays a descriptive text below the image if provided.

## Code Implementation

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import NextImage from "next/image";

const CustomImage = ({
  src,
  alt,
  width = 2000,
  height = 1000,
  caption,
}: {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  caption?: string;
}) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const aspectRatio = height / width; // Calculate aspect ratio

  return (
    <div className="w-full mb-4">
      <div
        className="relative w-full"
        style={{ paddingBottom: `${aspectRatio * 100}%` }}
      >
        {/* Skeleton Loader */}
        {isLoading && (
          <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-muted animate-pulse" />
        )}

        {/* Next.js Image (maintains aspect ratio) */}
        <NextImage
          src={src}
          alt={alt}
          width={width}
          height={height}
          className={`absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full transition-opacity duration-500 ${
            isLoading ? "opacity-0" : "opacity-100"
          }`}
          style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
          onLoadingComplete={() => setIsLoading(false)}
        />
      </div>

      {caption && (
        <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">{caption}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomImage;
```

## Key Features and Benefits

### 1. **Preserves Aspect Ratio**

By wrapping the `NextImage` component in a `div` with a dynamic `padding-bottom` based on the aspect ratio, the image maintains its expected proportions without layout shifts.

### 2. **Skeleton Loader for Better UX**

A subtle loading animation is displayed while the image is fetching, creating a smoother user experience.

### 3. **Improved Performance**

By leveraging `next/image`, the component benefits from Next.js’s automatic optimizations, such as lazy loading and efficient image rendering.

### 4. **Optional Caption Support**

Adding a caption below the image makes it more descriptive and useful for accessibility and SEO.

## Naming Considerations

Naming the component `CustomImage` inside `custom-image.tsx` avoids confusion with the built-in `next/image` import. This change improves clarity and maintains best practices for naming conventions in Next.js projects.

## Conclusion

This reusable `CustomImage` component enhances the standard `next/image` with additional usability features, ensuring responsive, optimized, and aesthetically pleasing image rendering in a Next.js project. By implementing a skeleton loader, maintaining aspect ratios, and supporting captions, this component improves user experience while leveraging Next.js’s powerful image optimization capabilities.
