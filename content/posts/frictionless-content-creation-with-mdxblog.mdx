Our mission is to take the friction out of content creation. We wanted a blogging platform that was easy to use, developer friendly - and that makes content creation a pleasure... so we built one with Next.js and MDX.

**Why MDXBlog?**

MDXblog stores posts as markdown files on the local machine, eliminating the need for a round trip to a database every time we want to write or edit a post. Content creation with local files just feels more intuitive. We can even create content in our favoite text editor or IDE.

MDX blog uses MDX format which gives us the power to include React components directly in the Markdown documents. This means we can include interactive elements like forms, buttons, and more in our posts in a much more developer-friendly way.

**Key Features:**

- **Style as You Write**: MDX content is styled with Markdown syntax. This is the most developer-frindly way: styling without needing to lift your fingers from the keyboard.
- **Quick Post Creation**: In development mode, creating a new post is as simple as clicking a '+' icon in the nav bar. It instantly generates a new post for you to start writing.
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Set future dates for your posts, and MDXBlog will ensure they go live when they’re supposed to—no manual intervention required.
- **Custom Components**: Seamlessly add YouTube videos, images, and code snippets to your posts using built-in React components.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Next.js handles the rendering of your content, ensuring it loads quickly and is SEO friendly. You can focus on writing, and MDXBlog takes care of the rest.

**Why We’re Sharing It**

We built MDXBlog to make content creation easier. It’s open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/owolfdev/mdx-blog). You can use the basic, stable version or explore our active code base if you want to explore the full features.

**Getting Started**

To get started, clone the [repo](https://github.com/owolfdev/mdx-blog), run `npm install`, and you should be good to go.

**In Summary**

MDXBlog is a simple, practical tool designed to remove the friction from blogging. It’s about making content creation as smooth and straightforward as possible. MDXBlog might be especially useful to content creators who are software developers as well.
