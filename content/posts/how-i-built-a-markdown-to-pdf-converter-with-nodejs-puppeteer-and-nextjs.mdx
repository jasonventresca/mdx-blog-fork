In this article, I’ll walk you through how I built a **full-stack** [Markdown-to-PDF conversion service](https://md2pdf.owolf.com), combining a simple Node.js backend and a modern Next.js frontend.

The goal was simple:  
**Allow users to paste Markdown into a form, and download a styled PDF document — instantly.**

## The Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Puppeteer
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS 4 + ShadCN UI components
- **Deployment**:
  - Backend API server on **DigitalOcean** (Ubuntu 22.04 droplet)
  - Frontend web app on **Vercel**
- **Libraries**:
  - Backend:
    - `express`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`
    - `markdown-it`, `markdown-it-container`
    - `puppeteer`
  - Frontend:
    - `next` (v15.3.0)
    - `react` (v19)
    - `tailwindcss` (v4)
    - `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `class-variance-authority`
    - UI behavior powered by `@radix-ui/react-tabs`

## Backend: Building the Markdown-to-PDF API

The backend server is a lightweight Express app that:

1. Accepts a `POST` request containing raw Markdown.
2. Parses it into styled HTML.
3. Converts the HTML into a PDF using Puppeteer.
4. Sends the PDF back to the client for download.

### Markdown Parsing

Markdown is parsed using `markdown-it`, with special extensions for **custom page breaks**:

```javascript
const md = markdownIt().use(markdownItContainer, "pagebreak", {
  render: function (tokens, idx) {
    if (tokens[idx].nesting === 1) {
      return '<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>';
    }
    return "";
  },
});
```

This allows users to manually insert page breaks inside their Markdown.

### HTML Styling

The HTML output is wrapped in a basic template with embedded CSS for:

- Body padding, font sizing, and line height
- Table styling (bordered, striped rows)
- Page break styling (`div[style*="page-break-after"]`)

This ensures the PDF has a clean, readable, consistent appearance.

### PDF Conversion

Using Puppeteer (headless Chrome), the server:

- Loads the generated HTML
- Applies margins and A4 page size
- Generates a PDF in-memory
- Streams it back to the client

Example PDF generation:

```javascript
await page.pdf({
  path: outputPath,
  format: "A4",
  margin: { top: "20mm", right: "20mm", bottom: "20mm", left: "20mm" },
});
```

Finally, rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`) was added to protect the server from abuse.

## Frontend: Next.js App for Markdown Input

The frontend is built with **Next.js 15** using the **App Router** and Tailwind CSS 4.

It provides:

- A text editor (`Textarea`) to paste or write Markdown
- Tabs to **Edit**, **Preview**, and pick from **Templates**
- Download button to generate and download the PDF

Everything is beautifully styled using **TailwindCSS**, **Radix Tabs**, and **ShadCN UI** components.

### Markdown Preview

To show a simple live preview without heavy libraries, I wrote a small Markdown-to-HTML converter for the preview pane:

```javascript
const html = content
  .replace(/^# (.*$)/gm, '<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">$1</h1>')
  .replace(/^## (.*$)/gm, '<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-3">$1</h2>')
  .replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, "<strong>$1</strong>")
  .replace(/\*(.*?)\*/g, "<em>$1</em>")
  .replace(/\n\n/g, "<br/><br/>");
```

(For production, something like `marked` or `react-markdown` would be more robust.)

### Templates

The frontend offers quick-start templates (like **Resume**, **Project Report**, and **Formal Letter**) that users can click to auto-fill the editor.

This speeds up the process and helps users unfamiliar with Markdown syntax.

### Download Action

When users click **Download PDF**, the client sends a `POST` request to the backend:

```javascript
export async function convertMarkdownToPdf(markdown: string): Promise<Blob | null> {
  const response = await fetch("https://md2pdfapi.owolf.com/api/convert", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ markdown }),
  });

  if (!response.ok) return null;
  return await response.blob();
}
```

The PDF Blob is then downloaded **automatically** via a hidden `<a>` link.

## Deployment

- **Backend** (`md-to-pdf` API server):
  - Deployed on a **DigitalOcean** droplet (Ubuntu 22.04).
  - Runs a simple Node.js app with Puppeteer installed.
- **Frontend** (Next.js web app):
  - Deployed on **Vercel**.
  - Automatic HTTPS, edge caching, and CI/CD for fast updates.

---

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Puppeteer requires special flags (`--no-sandbox`) to run on DigitalOcean without a full desktop environment.
- Basic rate-limiting is important to avoid potential abuse.
- Page break handling was trickier than expected — HTML/CSS alone needs special tricks to get it right for PDFs.
- Keeping things lightweight improves UX:  
  No heavy client-side libraries, no unnecessary Markdown renderers — fast and clean.

---

## Final Result

- **Frontend**: Clean, simple, fast Markdown editor with live preview and templates.
- **Backend**: Reliable, secure Markdown-to-PDF conversion engine.
- **User experience**: Paste → Preview → Download PDF in seconds.

# ✨ Future Improvements

Some ideas to make it even better:

- Add file upload support (upload `.md` files)
- Save previous documents for logged-in users
- Offer style/theme options (modern, professional, academic)
- Queue large jobs and email the PDF when ready (for very large markdown)
- Allow image upload or embedded media support

# Conclusion

This project was a fun and practical full-stack build — and a great example of how you can combine **Node.js**, **Puppeteer**, and **Next.js** to create useful, production-ready web services.

If you’re looking to spin up a project that combines real-world Markdown usage, PDF generation, and modern web app design — this stack works beautifully.
