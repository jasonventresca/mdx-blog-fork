One of our goals for this site is to keep it fast, focused, and pleasant to read â€” without unnecessary clutter.

When we decided to add a **comment system** to our blog posts, we had a few requirements:

- Comments should be lightweight â€” no external heavy platforms.
- Readers should be able to **comment anonymously** without needing an account.
- Replies should be supported â€” simple threaded discussions.
- The experience should feel modern and smooth, but **minimalist**.
- Admins (me) should be able to **edit and delete** any comment directly.

Hereâ€™s how we built it.

---

## The Tech Stack

The comment system integrates tightly with the blog, built using:

- **Next.js 15** (with the App Router and server actions)
- **Supabase** as the backend database
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ShadCN UI** for modern, consistent components
- **TypeScript** everywhere for strict typing

---

## Database Structure

On the database side (in Supabase), we created a simple table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mdxblog_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  post_slug TEXT NOT NULL,
  author_name TEXT,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  replied_to_id UUID REFERENCES mdxblog_comments(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **Top-level comments** have `replied_to_id = null`.
- **Replies** store the `id` of the parent comment in `replied_to_id`.

This creates a clean parentâ€“child relationship between comments and replies.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Comments:**  
   On the server (inside the blog page), we query all comments for the given post slug during server-side rendering, and pass them as props to the client.

2. **Displaying Comments:**  
   A `CommentSection` component renders a **Leave a Comment** button (instead of a huge empty form).  
   When clicked, a **ShadCN Dialog** pops open containing the comment form.

3. **Posting Comments:**  
   When a user submits a comment, a **server action** adds it to the Supabase database and updates the local comment list immediately.

4. **Replies:**  
   Replies are implemented recursively.  
   A reply is just another comment that happens to have a `repliedToId` pointing to its parent.  
   Replies are visually indented, but they don't get their own bottom border like top-level comments do.

5. **Admin Controls:**  
   If the app is running in development mode (`isDevMode()`), admin users can **edit** or **delete** any comment directly from the UI.

---

## Handling Edge Cases

- Comments are stored in **local storage** so anonymous users can still edit or delete their own comments during the same session.
- We manually **mapped the database fields** (which come in `snake_case`) to our frontend models (which use `camelCase`) to keep TypeScript happy.
- We made sure **only top-level comments** render dividers (`border-b`). Replies are indented without extra borders or padding that would create awkward gaps.

---

## Why Not Realtime?

At first, we considered using **Supabase Realtime** to live-stream new comments into the page.

However, for a personal blog â€” where live, multi-user editing isnâ€™t a strong requirement â€” it made more sense to keep things simple:

- New comments are added directly into local React state after posting.
- No open WebSocket connections.
- Lighter, faster, and more resource-efficient.

If needed later, adding Realtime would only take about 10â€“20 lines of extra code.

---

## Final Result

âœ… Readers can leave comments anonymously.  
âœ… We can manage comments easily when editing the blog.  
âœ… The UX feels modern and minimal.  
âœ… The system is lightweight, secure, and extendable for the future.

---

## Future Improvements

In the future, we might polish the system with small enhancements:

- **Scroll into view** after posting a new comment
- **Fade-in animations** when comments appear
- **Soft vertical lines** between parent and child comments for better threading visualization
- **Better spam protection** if necessary

But for now, it does exactly what we need â€” without any extra bloat.
