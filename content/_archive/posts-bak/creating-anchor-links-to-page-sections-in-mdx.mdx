Enhance navigation and make content more accessible by creating anchor links to specific sections within a page. This feature is particularly useful for long-form content, such as guides or documentation, where users can quickly jump to relevant sections without excessive scrolling.

In this article, we'll describe how we implemented anchor links in MDX documents and why we chose this approach over alternatives. If you're a developer working with MDX or similar technologies, this will give you insight into our solution and help you implement something similar in your own projects.

### How We Create Anchor Links

In MDXBlog, we use `id` attributes on headings and other section elements to allow anchor linking. These `id` attributes make it easy to link directly to specific sections of the document using anchor tags (`#`). Here's how it works:

Section:

```mdx
## <div id="getting-started">Getting Started</div>

In this example, the <div> tag has an id attribute of getting-started. This ID allows us to create a link to this section by using an anchor tag elsewhere in the document:
```

Link to Section:

```mdx
[Getting Started](#getting-started)
```

When a user clicks on this link, they are automatically scrolled to the section with the corresponding ID. This method is straightforward, semantic, and works out-of-the-box in any MDX document.

#### Why We Use `id` Attributes in `divs`

- **Flexibility**: By using `div` elements with `id` attributes, we can apply additional styles or classes to sections beyond what's available in markdown syntax.
- **Control**: We can fine-tune the layout of sections with more complex designs while still enabling anchor linking.
- **SEO-Friendly**: This method keeps the HTML output clean and ensures that the content structure remains clear for search engines.

### Alternatives We Considered

There are other methods we could have used for anchor linking in MDXBlog, but they didn’t fit our needs as well as the `id` attribute approach.

1. **Using Auto-Generated IDs for Headings**

   - **How it works**: Some libraries automatically generate `id` attributes for headings (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) based on the heading text. This allows for linking without manually setting the `id`.
   - **Why we didn’t choose it**: While auto-generated IDs reduce the need for manual `id` creation, they can be unpredictable if the heading text changes. Additionally, it’s harder to customize the exact format or style of the `id` attributes.

2. **Manually Setting Heading IDs**

   - **How it works**: In this method, we manually add `id` attributes to headings (`<h2 id="section">Section Title</h2>`).
   - **Why we didn’t choose it**: While this is a straightforward approach, it limits our control over styling and customization. Using `div` tags with IDs instead allows for greater flexibility in organizing content and applying additional styles.

3. **JavaScript Scroll Management**
   - **How it works**: This method involves using JavaScript to dynamically manage scrolling to different sections, typically using event listeners or smooth scrolling libraries.
   - **Why we didn’t choose it**: Although this allows for smoother scroll transitions, it adds unnecessary complexity and JavaScript dependencies to the project. We wanted a simple, lightweight solution that relied purely on HTML and CSS.

### Why This Approach Works Best for MDXBlog

- **Simplicity**: This solution uses plain HTML with no additional dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to implement.
- **Maintainability**: By keeping the solution simple and predictable, we can easily add, remove, or update anchor links without worrying about breaking the layout.
- **Performance**: This approach avoids the need for JavaScript, ensuring faster load times and better performance, especially on static sites.

### Implementing This in Your MDX Project

To implement this anchor link method in your own MDX project, follow these steps:

1. **Add `id` Attributes to Sections**: Wherever you have a section that you want to link to, wrap the heading in a `div` tag with an `id`. For example:

   ```mdx
   ## <div id="my-section">My Section</div>
   ```

2. **Create Links to Sections**: Link to sections by using the `#` symbol followed by the `id` value in your anchor tags:

   ```mdx
   [Go to My Section](#my-section)
   ```

3. **Optional Styling**: If you want to style the sections differently, apply CSS classes to the `div` tags.

Here’s an example with anchor links that let users navigate to sections and back to the top:

```md
# <div id="sample-anchor-linked-section" className="pt-4">Sample Anchor Linked Section</div>
