**Thales of Miletus** was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer, often regarded as the first philosopher in Western tradition. A native of the Ionian city of Miletus, he sought to explain natural phenomena without relying on mythology, marking a shift toward rational inquiry. He proposed that water is the fundamental substance (archÃª) of all things, laying the groundwork for later natural philosophy.

Thales was also an accomplished mathematician, credited with foundational contributions to geometry, including the theorem that bears his name. He applied his knowledge practically, such as predicting a solar eclipse in 585 BCE and using geometric principles to measure the height of pyramids. As one of the Seven Sages of Greece, his influence extended beyond philosophy, shaping early scientific and mathematical thought.
