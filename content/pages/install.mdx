Option 1. Install [a basic template](https://github.com/owolfdev/next-template-mdx-shad). A spare and stable template, which may be a good starting point for a simple blog or to learn how to build a blog with MDX and Next.js. This version uses Next.js 14, the @next/mdx package, the app router, and more.

Option 2. Install [MDXBlog](https://github.com/owolfdev/mdx-blog), this site&apos;s codebase, including all the content, all the tools we use daily, as well as any issues that we are working to improve. This is the evolving template, and the latest version of the MDXBlog. This version currently uses Next.js 15, the @next/mdx package, the app router, and more.
