Our mission is to take the friction out of content creation. We wanted a blogging platform that was easy to use, developer friendly - and that makes content creation a pleasure... so we built one with Next.js and MDX.

**Why MDXBlog?**

MDXblog stores posts as markdown files on the local machine, eliminating the need for a round trip to a database every time we want to write or edit a post. Content creation with local files just feels more intuitive. We can even create content in our favorite text editor or IDE.

MDXblog uses MDX format which gives us the power to include React components directly in the Markdown documents. This means we can include interactive elements like forms, buttons, and more in our posts in a much more developer-friendly way.

[MDXBlog (mdxblog.io)](https://mdxblog.io) is an independently created blog app template built with the latest web technologies, offering a unique blogging experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Style as You Write**: MDX content is styled with Markdown syntax. This is the most developer-frindly way: styling without needing to lift your fingers from the keyboard.
- **Quick Post Creation**: In development mode, creating a new post is as simple as clicking a '+' icon in the nav bar. It instantly generates a new post for you to start writing.
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Set future dates for your posts, and MDXBlog will ensure they go live when they’re supposed to—no manual intervention required.
- **Custom Components**: Seamlessly add YouTube videos, images, and code snippets to your posts using built-in React components.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Next.js handles the rendering of your content, ensuring it loads quickly and is SEO friendly. You can focus on writing, and MDXBlog takes care of the rest.

### <div id='youtube'>`<YouTube />`: Seamlessly embed YouTube videos within your content</div>

To embed a YouTube video, use the `<YouTube />` component. Provide the `id` of the YouTube video you want to embed:

\<YouTube id="aqz-KE-bpKQ" />

- **id**: The unique identifier for the YouTube video. This can be found in the video URL after `v=`. For example, in `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ`, the `id` is `aqz-KE-bpKQ`.

To add an image to your content, use the `<Image />` component. You can also add a caption to describe the image:

\<Image

caption="trees, grass, and sky"
\/>

- **src**: The path to your image file. This should be relative to the root of your project or the `public` folder if using Next.js.
- **caption** _(optional)_: A short description or caption for the image.

### <div id='code'>`code`: Include and showcase code snippets with clarity and style</div>

To display a block of code, use the standard Markdown syntax with triple backticks (```) followed by the language identifier:

\```javascript  
console.log("Hello World")  
\```
